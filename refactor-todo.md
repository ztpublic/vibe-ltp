# React Chatbot Kit Refactor TODOs

-

- 
- Avatars: replace fixed bot avatar markup with a prop-driven default that supports images/initials and sizing/color overrides without CSS hacks.
- Loading control: make auto-dismiss of loading configurable per message (or globally) so spinners can persist until explicit completion/feedback.
